# Project Management Client

Codealong for a React App communicating to Express API


## To-Do / Wishlist
- [ ] API URL: extract to environment variable
- [ ] Avoid repeating configuration for all API calls. Some options:
    - extract all calls to a service (just as we did with auth service)
    - create an instance of axios with the default config: axios.create()

- [ ] After signup, redirect

- [ ] (rename getTheUser to setTheUser)
